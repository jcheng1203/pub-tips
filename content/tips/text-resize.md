Resizing text in Photoshop can be a tricky business.

The **Type** tool has two main modes:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th"><strong>Paragraph text</strong></td>
		<td>You create a box that contains all your text. As the name suggests, use paragraph text when you have multiple lines of text (aka paragraphs).<br/>
			You must make sure you have the <span class="tool">Type</span> tool selected when you're resizing paragraph text, or else the text will distort.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th"><strong>Point text</strong></td>
		<td>Your type goes on forever on a single line.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Troubleshooting Text

### Help! I typed multiple lines but I can only see the first line.

It's possible that your leading is set to some really high value that's pushing the rest of the lines of text outside of view.
