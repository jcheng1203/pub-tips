Resizing text in Photoshop can be a tricky business.

The **Type** tool has two main modes:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="gray"><strong>Paragraph text</strong></td>
		<td>You create a box that contains all your text. As the name suggests, use paragraph text when you have multiple line of text (aka paragraphs).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="gray"><strong>Point text</strong></td>
		<td>Your type goes on forever on a single line.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

You must make sure you have the **Type** tool selected when you're resizing text, or else the text will distort.
