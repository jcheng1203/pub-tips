## Photoshop UI

Refer to this image.

## Layers

Layers are one of the most powerful aspects of graphics editing software like Photoshop or Affinity Photo. Think about layers like a stack of transparencies. When you look down on the stack, you can see the top layer and any underlying layers that aren't covered up by whatever's on the top layer.

Layers are handy because they allow you to make changes to individual elements without affecting the whole image.

## Masks

Masks and layers go hand-in-hand. You can apply a mask to a layer to cover up parts of that layer that you don't want people to see.

Common applications:

* Add texture to an image.
* Photo manipulation (ex. isolating the outline of a person in a photo).

## Assignment

Recreate `layer-mask-exercise.jpg` using layers and masks.
