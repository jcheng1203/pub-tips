### Layers

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">What It Does</td>
		<td>
			<p>Layers are the fundamental building blocks of your design. Think about layers like a stack of paper. When you look down on the stack, you can only see the top layer. If part of the layer is transparent (like one of those old-school transparencies), then you can see whatever's under it.</p>
			<p>Layers are handy because they allow you to make changes to individual elements without affecting the whole image.</p>
			<p>You can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Show or hide a layer.</li>
				<li>Change the order of layers.</li>
				<li>Group related layers together.</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">How to Use It</td>
		<td>
			<p>From the file menu, select <span class="menu-cascade">Window > Layers</span> to display the <span class="tool">Layers</span> panel.</p>
			<p>Keyboard shortcuts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Move a layer lower in the order of layers: <span class="shortcut">⌘+]</span></li>
				<li>Move a layer higher in the order of layers: <span class="shortcut">⌘+[</span></li>
				<li>Create a group containing selected layers: <span class="shortcut">⌘+G</span></li>
				<li>Ungroup a group of layers: <span class="shortcut">Shift+⌘+G</span></li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">Best Practices</td>
		<td><ul>
				<li>Keep every element of your design on a separate layer.</li>
				<li>Give your layers descriptive names.</li>
				<li>Keep your layers organized in groups.</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Shapes

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">What It Does</td>
		<td>Create a scalable shape that you can size up or down without losing image quality or getting pixelation. You can also create your own custom shapes using the <span class="tool">Pen</span> tool.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">How to Use It</td>
		<td>Keyboard shortcut: <span class="shortcut">U</span>. Reminder: Hold <span class="shortcut">Shift+U</span> to toggle through the different shape tools.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">Best Practices</td>
		<td>Use the <span class="tool">Shapes</span> tool instead of the <span class="tool">Marquee</span> tool whenever you want to create a rectangle or ellipse. That way, you can scale the shape without losing image quality should you change your mind later.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Fill

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">What It Does</td>
		<td>Change the color of any layer or selection.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">How to Use It</td>
		<td>Fill with foreground color: <span class="shortcut">Alt+Delete</span><br/>
			Fill with background color: <span class="shortcut">⌘+Delete</span><br/>
			Swap foreground and background colors: <span class="shortcut">X</span><br/>
			Reset colors to black and white: <span class="shortcut">D</span>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
