You don't need powerful (and expensive) tools like Adobe Photoshop to create good designs. At the same time, you could be a Photoshop expert but not know how to create good designs.

So before we dive into the tools, we need to know what contributes to a good design.

We will cover four main ideas in this lesson:

1. Composition
2. Typography
3. Colors
4. Image selection

## Composition

<div class="quote">
	<div class="quote-content">Composition is the placement or arrangement of visual elements or "ingredients" in a work of art, as distinct from the subject.</div>
	<div class="quote-credit">

	</div>
</div>

## Typography

<div class="quote">
	<div class="quote-content">Typography is the visual component of the written word.</div>

## Colors

<div class="quote">
	<div class="quote-content">Color theory is a practical combination of art and science that’s used to determine what colors look good together.</div>

## Image Selection

Look on Instagram and popular themes on Squarespace or Wix and it's clear that this formula is true:

`nice photo + nice typography = nice design`

So how do we select a good image? First you need to know where to look. My go-to for any kind of photo is [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). You can create an account to save collections.

## Assignment

Now that we've covered the fundamentals of design, let's put it to work! 

1. Create a [Canva](https://www.canva.com) account.
2. Take some time to explore the various templates.
3. Create the following types of images:
	1. Instagram post for IH monthly.
	2. Splash for baptism (dimensions: `1920 pixels × 1080 pixels`).

**Note:** Canva isn't great for print design, so we'll only be playing around with designing web graphics for this lesson.
