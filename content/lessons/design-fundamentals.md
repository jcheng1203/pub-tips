You don't need powerful (and expensive) tools like Adobe Photoshop to create good designs. At the same time, you could be a Photoshop expert but not know how to create good designs.

So before we dive into the tools, we need to know what contributes to a good design.

We will cover four main ideas in this lesson:

1. Composition
2. Typography
3. Colors
4. Image selection

## Composition

From Wikipedia:

	<div class="quote-content">Composition is the placement or arrangement of visual elements or "ingredients" in a work of art, as distinct from the subject.</div>
