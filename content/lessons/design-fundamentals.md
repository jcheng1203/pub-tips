You don't need powerful (and expensive) tools like Adobe Photoshop to create good designs. At the same time, you could be a Photoshop expert but not know how to create good designs.

So before we dive into the tools, we need to know what contributes to a good design.

We will cover two main ideas in this lesson:

1. Elements of Design
2. Principles of Design

## Elements of Design

* Line
* Shape
* Type
* Form
* Texture
* Space
* Color
* Value

## Principles of Design

* Balance
* Alignment
* Unity
* Emphasis
* Contrast
* Proportion
* Pattern
* Movement

## Putting the Elements and Principles to Use

Look on Instagram or any graphic design blog and it's clear that this is the basic formula to create a good design:

`nice photo (or illustration) + nice typography = nice design`

Refer to the [Design Resources](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rfsF5GWpBNKDyDyIeCaqu4d4yPnsythE2ysAbkedWQw) spreadsheet for a list of good websites where you can find high-quality fonts, photos, and illustrations (often for free!).

## Assignment

Evaluate the following images based on how well they adhere to the principles of design.
