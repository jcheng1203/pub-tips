	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">How to Use It</td>
		<td>Select the layer you want to add a mask to and click the [insert image] icon. Fill the mask with black wherever you want to hide the layer, and fill it with white wherever you want to reveal the layer.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">Common Applications</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Add texture to a layer. Example: Use a brush to give a layer a watercolor texture.</li>
