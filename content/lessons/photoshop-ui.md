## Tools Covered in this Lesson

Photoshop UI:

* Tools panel
* Options bar
* Panels
* Workspaces

### Tools panel

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">What It Does</td>
		<td>Most of what you need to create and manipulate elements.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">How to Use It</td>
		<td>The <span class="tool">Tools</span> panel is visible by default. If it's not visible, select <span class="menu-cascade">Window > Tools</span> to display it again.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">Best Practices</td>
		<td>Use keyboard shortcuts instead of the <span class="tool">Tools</span> panel whenever possible. Exception: Click the foreground and background color icons near the bottom of the panel to change the active color.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Options bar

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">What It Does</td>
		<td>Configuration options for the selected tool.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">How to Use It</td>
		<td>Select <span class="menu-cascade">Window > Options</span>.</td>
	</tr>
	</tr>
</table>

### Panels

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">What It Does</td>
		<td>Each panel does something a little different. We'll discuss some panels in greater detail as we cover different tools.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">How to Use It</td>
		<td>Select <span class="menu-cascade">Window > <em>Pick a panel</em></span>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">Best Practices</td>
		<td>
			Play around with different <span class="tool">Workspaces</span> to decide what panels you use the most. The panels I always like to have open are:
			<ul>
				<li>Swatches</li>
				<li>Character</li>
				<li>Paragraph</li>
				<li>Layers</li>
			</ul></td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Workspaces

<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">What It Does</td>
		<td>Saves a particular arrangement of panels.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">How to Use It</td>
		<td>Select <span class="menu-cascade">Window > Workspace > <em>Pick a workspace</em></span>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="horiz-th">Best Practices</td>
		<td>The default Photoshop workspace is called <span clas="tool">Essentials</span>. Once you get comfortable with Photoshop, save a custom workspace that displays all the panels that you most commonly use. <br/><br/> <strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/workspace-basics.html#save_and_switch_workspaces">Save and switch workspaces</a>.</td>
