## Terminology

* **Typography** is the visual component of the written word.
* **Typeface** is the design of a set of characters.
* **Font** `= typeface + style + size`.

Professionals can get pretty persnickety about the difference between the two terms, but in this class you can use the terms pretty much interchangeably.

## Rules of Good Typography

The fundamental law of good typography: 

<div class="quote">
	<div class="quote-content">Good typography reinforces the meaning of the text.</div>
	<div class="quote-credit">

	</div>
</div>

In addition to this fundamental law, there are some basic rules that govern good typography. Of course, rules are meant to be broken, but it's good to follow these rules until you get a pretty good feel for what kind of typography looks good.

1. Don't use more than 3 typefaces in one image.
2. Don't pair together fonts that are too similar to each other.
