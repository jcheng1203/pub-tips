## Prerequisites

Install [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/free-trial-download.html).

If you've already used your free trial for Photoshop and you don't want to pay the subscription fee, a good alternative is [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/desktop/). You can download a free trial of it, or just pay a one-time fee to purchase it.

This course will teach according to the Photoshop UI and controls, but many of the keyboard shortcuts and tools in Affinity are the same as those in Photoshop. Here's a side-by-side comparison of the two tools: [Photoshop vs. Affinity Photo](https://www.slant.co/versus/3818/3819/~photoshop_vs_affinity-photo).
